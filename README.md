# BookSwap

GT Book Swap Web App is a website application that allows users to exchange their

used textbooks among GT students. There is a book swap page for a Georgia Tech student on 

Facebook called “GT Book Swap”. The page, however, has a lack of features and structural 

problems which make this difficult to use. For instance, site users have to scroll down to look up 

posts since Facebook is a single-paged scrolling over web design, Facebook does not provide a 

variety of search options such as search by keywords or course, and it also does not provide the 

precise information about textbooks such as author, title or ISBN. Our GT Book Swap Web App is 

a user-friendly textbook exchange website application, and it is designed to resolve the problems 

of a Facebook page by providing quick search options, sorting posts by prioritizing them and 

suggesting a better communication between buyers and sellers.
